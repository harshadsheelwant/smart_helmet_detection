This project or rather study is a full-proof safety measure for Two Wheeler users. This project uses Computer Vision technologies : TensorFlow & OpenCV to detect helmets using a live feed captured by a camera fitted in the Dashboard of two-wheeler. The whole prototype system was enacted on RaspberryPi model using a PiCamera and Python as the core programming language. 

The project has further scope in getting actually fitted in a bike/two-wheeler and make roads safer than they are.
